# Kevin Plascencia — UX Portfolio (Tailwind)

This is a simple, GitHub Pages–ready UX portfolio built with Tailwind CSS via CDN.

## What's included
- `index.html` — main portfolio page
- `projects/` — three placeholder project pages
- `assets/` — placeholder images you can replace
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Replace the placeholder images in the `assets/` folder with your project screenshots (keep the same filenames or update paths in `index.html`).
2. Edit `index.html` and `projects/*.html` to update text, project descriptions, and your contact email.
3. Create a GitHub repository (e.g., `portfolio`) and push all files to the `main` branch.
4. In your GitHub repo, go to **Settings → Pages**, set the source to **main branch** and the folder to **/** (root).
5. The site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` in a few minutes.

## Notes
- The contact form is a demo and does not send emails. Integrate a form backend or services like Formspree / Netlify Forms to enable submissions.
- Tailwind is loaded via CDN for simplicity. For production workflows, consider a build step with Tailwind CLI for optimized CSS.

Enjoy — replace content with your case studies and screenshots!
